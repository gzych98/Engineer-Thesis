The subject of this paper was a CFD analysis of a check valve from Nikola Tesla’s patent.

The problem of flow through the valve was investigated using modern computer analysis software. The values of its operating parameters and the function connecting the shape parameters with the value of the pressure loss difference for the flow in forward and backward direction.

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) as a branch of fluid mechanics uses numerical analysis to solve fluid flow problems. Computers are used to perform the calculations required to simulate free share layer flow and fluid interaction with surfaces defined by boundary conditions. Particularly troublesome in numerical analyses are fluid flows along walls. Over the years, researchers have experimentally determined the equations describing this flow so that they can eventually be used in computer calculations.

Another important problem that stands in the way of performing CFD analysis is to discretize the model. This is important because the numerical calculations should be performed in the shortest possible time and the results must be independent of the final shape of the generated mesh.

CFD analysis is based on the mathematical representation of viscous fluid flow by the Navier-Stokes equations. These equations are the origin of turbulence models, which approach the flow in their own characteristic way and are therefore applicable to a wide variety of objects. By performing experiments for different input parameters we can obtain information about the values for which the model meets the design assumptions. Visualization of real fluid flow through the model by generating current lines or pressure distribution is invaluable in fluid mechanics. It allows to discover structural defects at the design stage and minimize the risk of failure.
